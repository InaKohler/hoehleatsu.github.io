## Abstract

We provide Bayesian decision support for revealing the identity of
opponents in the board game *Inkognito*. This includes the use of
combinatorics to deduce the likelihood of observing a particular
configuration and a sequential Bayesian belief updating scheme to
infer opponent's identity. From a R point of view we use base R where
it's best: manipulating matrices and supplement this with modern
`dplyr` style manipulation of data frames and `magrittr` pipes for
sequential belief updating.

## Introduction

[Inkognito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkognito) is a board game
for four players first published in 1988. Each player has a secret
**identity** (either Lord Fiddlebottom, Madame Zsa Zsa, Col. Bubble or
Agent X) and moves four figures around the game board (a tall, a
short, a fat, and a thin figure). However, only one of the figures
(the player's so called **build** type) is the player, the other three
are smokescreen, i.e. friendly spies serving to confuse the other
players. As part of the game one has to learn the identity and build
of the other players in order to solve a mission goal. To this end the
players move on the board, whenever one of the four figures meets one
of the figures of an opponent, the opponent has to reveal information
about their identity and build. There is a further neutral character,
the so called **ambassador**, which can be moved by all players. There
are two types of revelations depending on which figures meet:

1. **Player question**: The player can decide to ask the opponent
   about either identity or build. If the question is about the
   *identity* the player has to state two (of the four) identities and
   one (of the four) builds. At least one of the three statements has
   to be correct, for example, if the opponent is Agent X and has the
   thin figure, then the statement could be: I'm Lord Fiddlebottom or
   Madame Zsa Zsa and have the thin figure. Conversely, if the
   question is *build* then two builds and one identity is stated --
   again at least one of the statements has to be true.
2. **Ambassador question** about either identity or build: If about
   identity the opponent has to state two identities, one of them has
   to be correct. Similarly if the question is about build.

The information arising from each question is logged on a so called
**worksheet** as shown below. The picture shows the logged information
a game where the player asked one opponent (the red figure) a total of
three questions (two player questions and one ambassador question).

The idea is to sequentially guide your questioning in order to reveal
the identity of the other players and their build. For a more detailed
description of the game see this
[review](http://www.theboardgamefamily.com/2015/03/inkognito-deduction-game-review/)
or this
[even longer review](http://islaythedragon.com/featured/carnival-of-spies-a-review-of-inkognito/). In
what follows, we shall be less interested in all the particularities
of the game and focus on the sequential belief update of identity and
build from the questions, which is central part of the game.

## Statistical Approach to the Belief Updating

We cast the questioning into mathematical notation as follows. Let
$I\in \{1,2,3,4\}$ be the opponent's identity and $B=\{1,2,3,4\}$ the
opponent's build. Let

$$
D_k=(I_{k,1},I_{k,2},I_{k,3},I_{k,4},B_{k,1},B_{k,2},B_{k,3},B_{k,4})'
$$

be the information the opponent offers the $k$'th time the person is
asked about the identity. Here, $I_{k,j}$ is an indicator variable
showing whether in the $k$'th question the opponent claims to have
identity $j$. Furthermore, $B_{k,j}$ is an indicator variable showing
whether the opponent in the $k$'th question claims to have aspect $j$.
Altogether $D_k$ corresponds to one row of information in the
worksheet. In what follows we address the two types of questions, the
resulting likelihoods and how a Bayesian framework can be used to
update the belief about the opponent's identity and build.

### Player question about identity or aspect

A player question consists of asking the opponent about either their
identity or build. In response the opponent has to provide 3 pieces of
information: if asked about the identity two of the statements have to
concern the identity and one the build. Similarly, if asked about the
build, one identity and two build statements have to be given. In
other words, if the question is about identity, the vector $D_k$ has
to be such that $\sum_{j=1}^4 I_{k,j} = 2$ and $\sum_{c=1}^4 B_{k,c} =
1$. Furthermore, at least one of the three statements provided needs
to be true, i.e. if the opponent has identity $i$ and build $b$, then
the provided information has to be such that

$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{j=1}^4 I(I=i) I_{k,j} + \sum_{c=1}^4 I(B=b) B_{k,c}
\geq 1 &\Leftrightarrow I_{k,i} + B_{k,b} \geq 1.
\end{align*}
$$

### Ambassador question

If instead a player moves the ambassador on the same location as
another player's figure, then one can -- as before -- inquire about
the other player's identity or build. However, when the ambassador
asks one has to provide two statements about the inquired aspect -- of
which one has to be true. In other words, the answer to an ambassador
question $D_k$ will be such that the sum over either the identity
indicators or the builds equal 2. Furthermore, again assuming that the
opponent's true identity is $i$ and true build is $b$ we must have

$$
I_{k,i} + B_{k,b} =  1,
$$

because the answer will either be to identity or build.

## Implementation in R

We implement the possible configurations $D_k$ on the worksheet as a
matrix. Base R code does this very effectively:


```r
##Factor levels of identities and builds
identities <- paste0("I",1:4)
builds <- paste0("B",1:4)
##Make a matrix containing all levels
M <- expand.grid(identity=1:4,build=1:4,
                 I1=0:1,I2=0:1,I3=0:1,I4=0:1,B1=0:1,B2=0:1,B3=0:1,B4=0:1) %>%
     as.matrix
head(M,2)
```

```
##      identity build I1 I2 I3 I4 B1 B2 B3 B4
## [1,]        1     1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
## [2,]        2     1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```

```r
##Subset only to valid configurations
iRows <- 3:6
bRows <- 7:10

##Player questions about identity or build
pqI <- (rowSums(M[,iRows]) == 2) & (rowSums(M[,bRows]) == 1)
pqB <- (rowSums(M[,iRows]) == 1) & (rowSums(M[,bRows]) == 2)
##Ambassafor questions about identity or build
aqI <- (rowSums(M[,iRows]) == 2) & (rowSums(M[,bRows]) == 0)
aqB <- (rowSums(M[,iRows]) == 0) & (rowSums(M[,bRows]) == 2)

##At least one of the provided information has to be correct,
##i.e. I_{k,i_true} or A_{k,b_true} has to be one.
atleast1  <- (M[cbind(1:nrow(M),M[,1]+2)] + M[cbind(1:nrow(M),M[,2]+6)]) >= 1

##Restrict matrix to all valid answers
Mprime <- data.frame(M, atleast1=atleast1, pqI=pqI, pqB=pqB, aqI=aqI, aqB=aqB) %>%
  filter(pqI | pqB | aqI | aqB)

##Additional column containing the identity build combination
Mprime %<>% mutate(ib=paste0("I",identity,"/B",build)) %>%
  select(ib, everything())

##Show 3 random rows to get an impression
Mprime[sample(1:nrow(Mprime), size=3), ]
```

```
##        ib identity build I1 I2 I3 I4 B1 B2 B3 B4 atleast1   pqI  pqB   aqI   aqB
## 783 I3/B4        3     4  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1     TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
## 769 I1/B1        1     1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1     TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
## 308 I4/B1        4     1  1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0     TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

#### Likelihood

Considering the possible answers to a player question and assuming
that the true opponent values are $(i,b)$, then the opponent for a
player question can choose between one of a total of 15 valid
combinations:

- Assuming the identity will be correct in the revealed
  information,the opponent has to choose one of three remaining
  identities for the second information about identity and needs to
  pick between one of four builds to report (3*4=12 possible
  combinations).
- Assuming the build of the revealed information is correct, *but not
  the identity*, then the opponent has to choose 2 of the 3 remaining
  identities for the identity part of the revealed information
  (`choose(3,2)`=3 combinations).

Hence, the total number of possible valid combinations is 15, that is
the likelihood for each valid combination is 1/15. For a given
provided combination $D_k$ and $(i,b)$ we thus need to check if $D_k$
is valid given $(i,b)$. If not the likelihood is zero, if valid, then
the likelihood is 1/15.

For an ambassador question about identity, the opponent has to choose
their true identity and one of the three other identities, i.e. the
likelihood is easily found to be $1/3$, if the opponent is indifferent
about which of the three identities to report back. Altogether, given
our own identity $(i,b)$ we thus need to check if $D_k$ is possible
given $(i,b)$. If this is not the case then likelihood is zero,
otherwise the likelihood is 1/15.

## Likelihood Implementation in R

This is conveniently done using either an `apply` to the rows or --
allowing for a more readable way using the column names -- using a
`dplyr` mutate statement:


```r
##Compute likelihood for each valid answer (assuming indifference between choices)
Mprime %<>% mutate(prob = if_else(!atleast1, 0,
                                  if_else(aqI | aqB, 1/3, 1/15)))
```

### Prior

The prior distribution consists of the joint prior $P(I=i, B=b)$ for
all 4*4=16 combinations of identity and build. For easier vector
multiplication we flatten the table into a vector. In the particular
game, from which the above worksheet originates, the player with the
worksheet was $I=4$ and $B=2$, hence, we assign these states the
probability zero.


```r
##Factor levels of identities and builds
identities <- paste0("I",1:4)
builds <- paste0("B",1:4)
##Generate levels of joint table of identity and build
ib_combs <- as.character(outer(identities, builds, paste, sep="/"))
##Generate joint table based on player's identity
prior <- structure(as.numeric(outer(c(1/3,1/3,1/3,0), c(1/3,0,1/3,1/3))),names=ib_combs)
prior
```

```
##     I1/B1     I2/B1     I3/B1     I4/B1     I1/B2     I2/B2     I3/B2     I4/B2     I1/B3 
## 0.1111111 0.1111111 0.1111111 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.1111111 
##     I2/B3     I3/B3     I4/B3     I1/B4     I2/B4     I3/B4     I4/B4 
## 0.1111111 0.1111111 0.0000000 0.1111111 0.1111111 0.1111111 0.0000000
```

Furthermore, we create a small helper function `p_marginal` allowing
us to compute the marginal distributions of identity and build,
respectively, from the joint distribution. That is
$P(I=i)=\sum_{b=1}^4 P(i,b)$ and $P(B=b)=\sum_{i=1}^4 P(i,b)$.


This allows us to compute:

```r
p_marginal(prior, what="I")
```

```
##        I1        I2        I3        I4 
## 0.3333333 0.3333333 0.3333333 0.0000000
```

```r
p_marginal(prior, what="B")
```

```
##        B1        B2        B3        B4 
## 0.3333333 0.0000000 0.3333333 0.3333333
```

### Posterior

For $i=1,\ldots, 4$ and $b=1,...,4$ we can compute the posterior
distribution using Bayes' theorem:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(I=i,B=b\>|\>D_k) &= \frac{P(D_k|\>I=i,B=b)P(I=i,B=b)}{P(D_k)} \\
&=
\frac{P(D_k|\> I=i,B=b)P(I=i,B=b)}{\sum_{j=1}^4 \sum_{c=1}^4 P(D_k|\>
I=j,B=c)P(I=j,B=c)}.
\end{align*}
$$
In code:

```r
#############################################################
## Function for sequentially updating the state information
############################################################
update <- function(prior, Dk) {
  ##Sanity check
  stopifnot(names(prior) == ib_combs)

  ##Configurations matching the observed data Dk
  idx <- apply(Mprime[, grep("I+|B+", names(Mprime))], 1, function(x) all(x==Dk))

  ##Extract likelihood and put it in same order as the ib_combs vector
  ##for prior and likelihood vectors to match in order of the entries
  vector_idx <- pmatch(ib_combs, Mprime[idx,]$ib)
  lik <- (Mprime[idx,]$"prob")[vector_idx]

  ##Compute P(I=i,B=b|D_k), i.e. our updated belief
  belief <- lik * prior / sum(lik * prior)
  return(belief)
}
```

We use the data from the above shown worksheet, combine it with our
prior and thus update our belief of which identity and build the
opponent has.



```r
##The three data lines of the worksheet
D <- bind_rows(data.frame(I1=1,I2=0,I3=0,I4=0,B1=0,B2=1,B3=1,B4=0),
               data.frame(I1=0,I2=0,I3=0,I4=0,B1=0,B2=0,B3=1,B4=1),
               data.frame(I1=1,I2=1,I3=0,I4=0,B1=0,B2=0,B3=1,B4=0))

##Sequential belief updating (we use a version using pipes)
prior %>% update(D[1,]) %>% update(D[2,]) %>% update(D[3,]) -> belief
```

The above way of piping is a nice way to illustrate the sequential aspect of
the inference!


```r
##Show results
p_marginal(belief, what="I")
```

```
##   I1   I2   I3   I4 
## 0.50 0.25 0.25 0.00
```

```r
p_marginal(belief, what="B")
```

```
##   B1   B2   B3   B4 
## 0.00 0.00 0.75 0.25
```

Based on these results we are somewhat certain that the player has
identity 1, i.e. is Lord Fiddlebottom, and has build 3, i.e. is the
fat figure. The belief update can also be visualized as shown below for
identity.

## Discussion

After the end of the particular game the above worksheet is from, it
turned out that the opponent was $I=1$ and $B=4$. Altogether, the
opponent was not too impressed by the decision support provided by
this post: That identity 1 was most likely appears natural when simply
counting the number of crosses for this identity on the
worksheet. Same goes for the build, however, she was deliberately
attempting to fool the player by providing the impression that she was
build 3. As always with statistics, heuristics can take you part of
the way, however, simply counting crosses would for example not reveal
that identity 3 still also is an option. Furthermore, the slyness of
misinformation is not handled by the combinatorical approach towards
calculating the likelihood, because it is assumed that every valid
choice is equally likely. To this end, more games need to be played in
order to learn the opponent's confusion strategy and adapt the
probabilities to reflect these strategies. Finally, in longer games, one
would have answers from several opponents and this would be combined
in one model, because knowing opponent 1 is Lord Fiddlebotom certainly
also helps to rule out some options for opponent 2.

So what is next: If time permits, a shiny app allowing the user to fill in their
worksheet and calculate and visualize the subsequent belief about each opponent's
identity and build.
